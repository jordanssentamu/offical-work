                    We all have our challenges when we start to talk about our love journeries. I have so far loved three girls in my entire life and chrushed on many. 
                    Its funny though its the entire truth that am still crushing on other girls up to now.
                    But i do respect and love ma partner alot and i've never thought of leaving her nor cheat.</P>
                <P>
                    was pissed at her cz i saw as if she took me for a fool but she told me something that made realise that i was a famous guy and the girl i had was also famous.therefore everyone know the story.
                    for a second there we laugh and we contuined to know each other more and we promised each other never to fall for each other and we even swore to it near the HM office.
                    But as time went on she started falling for me and trust me it took me time to realise it cz i knew she was my best friend who understood what i was going through.
                    But i came to realise it later when one of her friends came to me and told me "Jordan dont you realise it that Oma is into you".
                    I couldnt believe it cz i was sure she knew our deal and i was sure she could honor it but her heart had already decided to fall for me.
                    i carried a test to see if what her friend was teeling was trust and indeed i comfirmed it was true.
                    I was sorry disappointed in her but i couldnt blame her and i later decided to learn to love her and that how our love started,
                    and we confirmed it in form four third as we were doing our UNEB examinations. we lasted in our relationship for two years and we end it in form six vacation
